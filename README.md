# Simple Javascript Game hosted with ruby on rails

Objectives :
1. Learning Ruby
2. DOM manipulation with vanilla Javascript
3. Learning Rails framework
4. Hands on MVC framework and understanding how it works
5. DB migrations and how Database connects to model 
6. Understanding how dependencies are installed 

Outcomes:
All objectives are done .
I won't use Ruby or rails as a 1st choice in future because it is very different from traditional languages and :symbols , and @instance variables can be very confusing sometimes . Also , it uses VM for multithreading , doesn't have native thread libraries .
Also , for doing the same thing I think python is better with Django .
Also Flask > Sinatra
